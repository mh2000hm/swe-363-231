            Our Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            The idea for My Flashcards began as we searched for a way to make studying more engaging, effective,
            and most importantly fun for students. However, our vision for our website does not just aim at gamifying the process 
            of studying, but it extends to helping students achieve results. Therefore, we knew from the beginning that we must 
            adhere to the feedback of students and hold ourselves to high academic standards.<br><br>
            The following table lists sample fields <b>My Flashcards</b> would support:
